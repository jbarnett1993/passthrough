In a file called bitcoin.py, implement a program that:

Expects the user to specify as a command-line argument the number of Bitcoins, 
, that they would like to buy. If that argument cannot be converted to a float, the program should exit via sys.exit with an error message.
Queries the API for the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index at https://api.coindesk.com/v1/bpi/currentprice.json, which returns a JSON object, among whose nested keys is the current price of Bitcoin as a float. Be sure to catch any exceptions, as with code like:
import requests

try:
    ...
except requests.RequestException:
    ...
Outputs the current cost of 
 Bitcoins in USD to four decimal places, using , as a thousands separator.
Hints
Recall that the sys module comes with argv, per docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.argv.
Note that the requests module comes with quite a few methods, per requests.readthedocs.io/en/latest, among which are get, per requests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/quickstart/#make-a-request, and json, per requests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/quickstart/#json-response-content. You can install it with:
pip install requests
Note that CoinDesk’s API returns a JSON response like:
